Ladakh was the main and most discussed topic when we friends meet up there after. Finally it come to a shape after collecting all the info. Before going into details on how we gathered the info I would like to thank my friends C Pavan (@PassionateFool), Akshay Bidkar (@Akshay_Bidkar), Shrikar Kalagi (@shrikarvk), Pavan Gandmali who contributed in planning and executing it. Also, thank them for their help in getting this blog out.\r\n\r\nHow did we congregate the info? \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Blogs - There are huge number of blogs like DOW available with all the necessary info. It also has all the cab rates and drivers' phone number (I'm not giving the link to fare chart as it keeps updating every 6 months)\r\n2. Twitter - We can easily find the relevant twitter handlers.\r\n3. Hashtags - Found the hashtags (say #Siachen, #Hanle) on Facebook and twitter. This gave us the first hand information as these were used by the ones who are currently at that location or who visited very frequently.\r\n4. Cab drivers - There are around 30-40 cab drivers' details on internet. We ringed almost everyone to ask about the best route, permits, weather, minimum time needed, stay and approximate fare. We did this very extensively because of tight schedule. We shortlisted few drivers depending on the reviews, fare and experience. Finally we chose go with Karma Sundup (+91-9419215193).\r\n5. Colleagues and friends - who recently visited. Though it was not very useful as none of them visited Siachen Base camp and Hanle observatory.\r\n\r\nWhile searching the blogs I found a note on http://www.carwale.com/ which sells the used car. One guy had put his Nano car on sale on this website and my google search landed me on that page as he had visited  Siachen base camp with his car (Yes! roads are that good). I found the same person on Facebook and pinged him to ask his mobile number and he was generous to share. Later he explained everything in detail which was really helpful. Interesting isn't it?\r\n\r\nSimilar story with Hanle observatory as well. Rarely people visit these places and very less info is on internet. You have to find ways like this to find the right people to get info.\r\n\r\nYes! We invested good amount of time on gathering the info. Once done, we finalized on the below route considering the flight rates as well.\r\n\r\n'Delhi - Manali - Leh - Khardung la - Diskit - Hunder - Shayok - Pangyong - Chusul - Hanle - Tso Moriri - Leh - Kargil - Srinagar - Delhi'\r\n\r\nFlight tickets were booked when we found a better deal. We booked tickets from -\r\n1. Bangalore - Delhi (August 5th early morning)\r\n2. Srinagar - Delhi (August 14th late evening)\r\n3. Delhi - Bangalore (August 15th late evening)\r\n\r\nWe chose these dates as August is an off-peak season in Ladakh. Less crowd implies cheaper travel and accommodation. Also, we had planned to be in Delhi on August 15th, the Independence day. Attending PM's speech in Red Fort was planned later.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparation \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Gather the permits\r\n\r\nInner Line Permit (ILP) - We need ILP only to visit Chusul (Indo-China war memorial) , Hanle (Astronomical observatory) and Tso Moriri(Lake, similar to pangyong). We Indians don't need permit to other places in Ladakh. ILP should be obtained from DC office in Leh. We got the sample formats, documents needed (any address proof would work), fees and also the timings of DC office (9AM-3PM).\r\nHanle observatory - There is an Astronomical observatory in Hanle (7hrs drive from Leh), must visit place in Ladakh region. This is maintained and operated by Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. It is one of the worlds highest sites with gamma ray telescopes. We have to send a mail to dean@iiap.res.in to get the permission and it was quite easy to get it.\r\nSiachen Base camp! - Permit to base camp was the most difficult one to arrange for. You should have an army officer (with rank Major and above) in your immediate family to get this and he should accompany you throughout the visit, which was very unlikely in our case. We tried almost everything to get the permission but din't workout. Just read on to find how we got this permission later from Partapur army camp (102 Brigadier)!\r\nIndependence Day pass - My relative's friend works in Ministry of Defence and he arranged the passes. It can be got from Rashtrapati Bhavan 1-2 weeks before Aug 15th. A photo and an address proof are enough to get this. The procedure is detailed in the website of Ministry of Defence. \r\n\r\n2. Study the Maps\r\n\r\nBefore starting any trip, complete map of the places you gonna visit must be at the tip of your tongue. We had planned and talked about these places so many times that we knew it by rote, which place comes where, in which direction and best route to take.\r\nThere is a map from DOW which covers the whole Ladakh region. They also have an android app (150rs per download) which gives pinpointed location and it's details (We chose not to pay as we got the same info from other blogs)\r\n\r\nMost importantly we listed the places and it's altitudes. 'Climb high and sleep low' is the mantra while you are touring above 10k Ft.\r\n\r\n3. Read about AMS\r\n\r\nAcute Mountain sickness is the most common illness which can affect anyone once you cross altitude more than 10,000 Ft. This is due to low air pressure and low oxygen levels. We read about the symptoms, how to prevent it, treatment etc. Khardung la at 18,000 ft has 40% less oxygen than Bangalore!\r\nHeadache, dry nose, giddiness are the common symptoms of AMS. Acetazolamide (Diamox) is the widely used drug to treat AMS. This is available in all the medical shops of Leh. If you are travelling by road then it's easy to acclimatize.\r\n4. Mobile SIM\r\n\r\nOnly postpaid SIMs from other states can be used in J&K. BSNL has better coverage than Airtel (There are no other networks). Airtel network is limited to citites like Leh and Srinagar. As Indian Army which is spread across the Ladakh region is dependent on BSNL telecom network, BSNL has reached every corner of Ladakh.\r\nThere should be at least one BSNL postpaid SIM in the group and @shrikarvk managed to get it for us.\r\n\r\n5. Hotels\r\n\r\nAs we were not travelling in the peak season (April - July is the peak season for Ladakh) we chose not to book hotels in all the places. We called few hotels in Leh to get an idea of the approx rates and shortlisted few budget hotels. We had the contact numbers incase we reach Leh late night.\r\n\r\nThere are enough options for stay in Leh, Manali and Srinagar. Only problem is Nubra valley and Pangyong lake. We planned the trip in such a way that by dark we would reach Leh and stay there. But it din't workout very well. Read on to see why that wasn't possible.\r\n\r\nIf you get a good driver then absolutely no need to worry about hotels. They have contact in all the places and they will also get food and accommodation free of cost as a compliment from hotel owners. This can be see across the Ladakh region.\r\n\r\nContacts se hi sab kuch hota hai!\r\n\r\n6. Taxi unions\r\n\r\nOnly JK 10 (RTO code of Leh) registered commercial vehicles are allowed in Ladakh region. If we hire a cab from Manali then he will just drop you to Leh and from there we have to find a local one. Same case with bikes as well.\r\nThere is a taxi stand near Leh bus stand and they have fixed rates in the taxi union, still bargaining is a must.\r\nThere is a different taxi stand for Srinagar route. Kargil/Srinagar registered vehicles ply in this route.\r\nAll kind of taxis are available in Leh - Innova, Xylo to Maruti Omni.\r\n\r\n7. Others\r\n\r\nCameras - I packed my Canon 1100D DSLR with 18-55 and 55-250mm lens. @PassionateFool had got his Sony camera and Xiomi YI action cam. Gopro cameras, canon/nikon lenses, camera holders, tripods can be rented from Leh. There are few shops only for camera accessories in main market.\r\nATMs - ATMs can be found only at Leh in Ladakh region. \r\nFuel stations - Found in Leh. There is one in Diskit (Nubra valley) as well.\r\nBikes - Bikes can be rented out from Leh on daily basis. Costs from 1k-1.5k depending on the season. We got Royal Enfield 350CC bike for 1k. Bike accessories like knee pads, helmet, jacket are also available for rent.\r\nFood - In Leh there are many options veg/non-veg, whilst in other places like Pangyong, Tangtse, Nubra we could see only veg hotels (May be we ignored non-veg hotels as we all were veggies). Ladakh runs on Maggi noodles! It's available EVERYWHERE! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Preps\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there was curfew in Srinagar and it was continuing from a month. Every driver, hotelier, army guys we spoke to told us not to visit Srinagar and return to Delhi via Manali. Also we had our flight from Srinagar on August 14th and it's Pakistan's Independence day. But we took a chance and din't cancel the tickets.\r\nBooked hotel in Manali as we had very limited time there.\r\nSpoke to Karma Sundup and told him to pick us from Manali, which saved us from finding another taxi in Leh as he had a JK 10 registered vehicle (Xylo).\r\nWe were not sure on getting permission to visit Siachen Base camp. Hence we kept 2 buffer days in the plan.\r\nShopped a pair of socks, jacket and winter wear shirts from Decathlon.\r\nGot some cash, copies of permit to visit Hanle observatory, copies of address proof (for ILP) and tickets.\r\nExecution\r\n\r\n\r\nDay 1(August 5th) - Sleepless night!\r\n\r\nFriends came to my place late night and packing went on for hours. We had to leave at 3:30AM as we had flight at 5:30AM from Bangalore. We had to collect Independence day passes (from Rashtapati Bhavan) on the same day as we were returning to Delhi only on August 14th evening. @shrikarvk and Pavan Gandmali got the passes and we started to Manali at 5PM from RK puram metro station.\r\n\r\nI felt bus services weren't as organized as we see it in Karnataka. We got a different company bus, seat numbers were completely messed up as the two travel agencies pooled the bus (Bus pooling?!), pick up location was changed at the last moment, reached Manali 2 hrs late than expected but it was right time to the driver!\r\n\r\nDay 2 - Met Karma Sundup, our companion for next whole week.\r\nReached Manali at 8:30AM and started to Leh at 12 noon.\r\nFirst glimpse of Himalays. \r\nCrossed Rhotang pass (13,050 ft) on NH21 - old Silk Route \r\nStayed over night at Keylong(10,100 ft), on the banks of Bhaga river. Many budget hotels are available here with wi-fi! Should reach before it's dark\r\nAll Manali-Leh HPRTC buses halt here\r\n126KMs from Manali\r\n\r\nDay 3 - Scenic views!\r\nStarted to Leh early morning (around 8)\r\nCrossed Barlach-la (16,050 ft), Nakee la(15,547 ft), Lachung la(16,598 ft) , Tanglang la (17,480 ft)\r\nGata loops are 22 hair pin bends between Nakee la nad Lachung la. Very beautiful place and we din't miss a chance to take some snaps.\r\nCities on the way - Jispa, Sarchu, Pang, Upshi, Karu\r\nFirst view of river Indus at Upshi\r\nReached Leh by dark. \r\nLeh is 360KMs from Keylong. Ya, a very long journey.\r\nMany options to stay in Leh.\r\n\r\nDay 4 - Nubra. Passage to Tibet.\r\n\r\nLeh city\r\n\r\nWe changed our plan of Leh(11,500 ft) local sight seeing instead we started to Nubra valley(Diskit and Hunder) as we all were feeling very healthy. We assumed we were acclimatized!\r\nWe started to Hunder by noon. It's 5hrs drive from Leh. We collected the ILPs from Leh DC office before we left to Nubra.\r\n\r\nCrossed Khardung la(18,380 ft) the so called highest motorable road in the world(Yes, it's not!). Clicked pics with the board by BRO(Border Road Organiztion). Literally we had to wait in a queue to shoot few pics in front of the board! The roads are really well maintained by BRO. It is strategically very important to India as it is the only route to Siachen. BRO struggles hard to keep this pass open through out the year. Around 10,000 camels and horses used to cross this pass in an year as this was the major caravan route few centuries back. Still we can see the bactrian double-humped camels in Hunder. Surprising isn't it? camels at 10k ft in himalayan range?!\r\n\r\nAvg altitude of this valley is 10,000 ft even less than Leh. We could see greenery in the valley. Other passes are just cold deserts. Because of the lower altitude and Shayok river (tributary of Indus river) this valley is very fertile.\r\n\r\nReached Hunder by evening 6PM (130KMs from Leh). Did a camel safari as well(200rs per person). One guy from Balti tribe who takes care of the camels came and spoke to us in Kannada! He completed his B.A degree in Mysore and he was there in his native for vacation. He had learnt so much kannada in just 3 years. We were delighted to hear him. May be he wouldn't have learnt kannada if he were in Bangalore. what say?!\r\n\r\n\r\nMilky way as seen from Sumur\r\nContacts of Karma helped us in getting a good hotel in Hunder and once it was dark @PassionateFool was very excited to click the Milky way in crystal clear sky.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay 5 - Planning of Siachen begins!\r\n\r\nBy next day morning we started discussing whether to visit Siachen Base camp or not. It was basically whether we get the permission. Karma, who is driving in Ladakh for past 15 years told us clearly that whatever it may be we will not get the permission and he had never taken any tourists there. So decision was made to return to Leh the same day. But @shrikarvk din't loose it so soon. He convinced Karma to take us to Partapur army camp, the brigade HQ of North Ladakh and try our luck. It is around 7KMs from Hunder. We were stopped at the TCP (Traffic Control Post) and we were allowed inside only after checking the IDs and told to check with Army Major in a far building.  @shrikarvk and me went inside once we deposited our mobiles at the gate. Then we informed the officer incharge and we had to wait for an hour just to know whether we will be allowed or not. \r\n\r\nFinally the wait was over, when we were informed that we will be allowed and he told us to give our details along with driver's and vehicle number. But the happiness din't last long as he was ready to give the permission only for the next day and the reason was, once we cross Sasoma (4hrs drive from Partapur) there wouldn't be any vehicle movements after mid noon, and in case our vehicle breaks down after that, then we are stuck there till next morning. It's a remote place and ONLY Army vehicles ply in that route and they din't wanted to take this risk, which was fair enough. It was clearly mentioned in our permit that we have to cross Sasoma TCP before 11AM the very next day. One extra day would cost us in dropping other places according to our plan. Karma was generous in telling us that he is ready to take us there as everyone visiting Ladakh won't get this opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBase camp permit\r\n\r\nWe had 2 buffer days (excluding day of Siachen visit) and we decided to visit Siachen next day. So the both the days were just gone, one day just to get the permit and other one for actual visit. We were on really tight schedule there after.\r\n\r\nAt first we thought to return to Hunder and start to Siachen from there early morning. Karma, after staying with us for few days suggested to stay in Sumur (3hrs drive from Hunder) as he knew we were the one's who love to sleep! and wouldn't wake up early morning, which is at 4AM. I agreed with him without a second thought as I was damn sure that it won't be possible by me. Also, it's not practical to wake up at 4AM in that cold. Isn't it?\r\n\r\nWe stayed overnight in Sumur which was a 50KMs journey. Me and @shrikarvk  were feeling sick in stomach, headache and also a bit tiredness. Unfortunately there were no medical shops in Sumur and also it was already dark by the time we reached. Seeing us sick, Karma gave us 'Saridon' the famous drug to get relief from headache. You will come to know why I mentioned the drug name here. Read on..\r\n\r\n\r\nDay 6 - Visit to Siachen Base Camp. Best part of the trip!\r\n\r\nNo improvement in my health, same with @shrikarvk. But we got the energy somehow as we were super excited. We crossed Panamik which is another 50KMs from Sumur. Civilians are only allowed till here. There is a holy hot water spring in Panamik which is visited by local Buddhist community. Also we could see Yarab Tso another holy lake in the middle of mountains. Awesome place!\r\n\r\nAfter Panamik we reached Sasoma TCP. Karma had to deposit his Driving license and the permit was double checked by giving a call to Partapur HQ, our IDs were also checked. Siachen TCP was also informed that we will be visiting in few hours. There is huge army camp is Sasoma where we could see some training going on. We visited this while returning.\r\n\r\n2hrs drive from there we reached Siachen TCP, where the permit was checked again. This was a very beautiful stretch running through the mountains and rivers and we saw no other vehicle till we reach Siachen.\r\n\r\nWe had to cross the huge cable bridge across Nubra river to reach the base camp. Once we entered we could see only army vehicles. There were army men in white jackets undergoing the training, they were into groups of 15-20 being briefed by their senior, few canons were kept where we could see it, atmosphere was very different there. At the end of the road we could see O.P BABA shrine, the secret guardian of all the soldiers posted on these snow mountains. Snout of the Siachen glacier was till this shrine in 2005. Peak of the glacier can be seen from this place. Siachen is the biggest non-polar glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\nOP BABA Shrine\r\nAn officer voluntarily came and told us about OP BABA, and briefed us about the glaciers and showed us the Pak and China borders, which were just another peaks. Actual border is around 100KMs from the base camp and there is no motorable road here after. One has to trek or go by Heli to reach any post after the shrine. He told us to meet the Colonel in charge and also radioed him. He also arranged a vehicle to his office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@O P BABA shrine\r\nColonel's office was nothing less to a CEO's office. We were impressed, as it's constructed in hostile conditions where outside temperature varies from 20C to -50C. Colonel welcomed us with warm water and later with hot tea. He asked about our job and other casual things. I told him that we all are from Dharwad, Karnataka. The place where L/Nk Hanumanthappa Koppad belongs to (Betadur village in Kundagol taluk of Dharwad district), he was martyred in Siachen earlier this year. He was alive even though he was buried in 35 ft deep snow that too for 6 days in -45C. There was a huge rally in Dharwad before his final rights were performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOP BABA the legend\r\nOnce he came to know we are from Dharwad he told us about him, why and how the accident happened, how did the rescue mission go and other things. I'm not detailing it here as this blog is already huge! Also he ringed Sasoma camp where Hanumanthappa's regiment (19th Madras) was stationed, he arranged lunch for us in there. He sent a jawan to accompany us till we leave the base camp. We told him that we need some medical help as we were sick. He informed the Doc and assured that he will take care of us.\r\n\r\nJawan who was with us took us directly to the doctor and we were really amazed by the treatment we got there. We were just expecting that he may do a basic check and give few tablets, but he went far ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSiachen War memorial\r\nSeeing our condition he immediately got us admitted in the hospital, and we were treated with few injections, saline bottles and even the oxygen supply. Treatment and care we got in remote place like Siachen was even better than any high end hospital. We were back to normal in just 1 hour and we were literally surprised to see that.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Siachen Base camp\r\n\r\nWhile leaving, the doctor told us that it's not because of AMS but it's side effect of the tablet which we took a day before and strictly told us not to self medicate without doctor's prescription in such high altitudes. He told us to visit any army camp in Ladakh region if we need any medical attention later. He also gave a written letter to get it in ease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce we were out of hospital we shopped gloves, caps and jackets in the Army canteen with 'Indian Army' written on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSiachen Base camp\r\nWe could see the Siachen Battle School, where soldiers who were about to be inducted on the glacier were rigorously trained for mountaineering and ice climbing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater we visited Siachen war memorial on the banks of Nubra river which is built in memory of martyred soldiers in the Siachen region. Majority of the soldiers have lost their lives due to adverse climatic conditions than the actual military operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSiachen Hut\r\nThen we moved on to visit Siachen Hut where all the accessories and food items used by Army on the glacier is showcased. Most of the accessories are imported and we could see no compromise as they were all of premium quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSiachen Battle school\r\nThen we left Siachen Base camp to Sasoma where 19th Madras was stationed. We reached there around 4PM. We were allowed inside after a security check as they knew in prior that we will be visiting them.\r\n\r\nWe were welcomed with tea and snacks. We found many soldiers who could speak Kannada as 30-35% of Mardas regiment is from Karnataka. Once they came to know that we are from Dharwad (Hanumanthappa's place) everyone in the regiment came and spoke to us. We were over whelmed by their response.\r\nWe spoke casually about their daily routine on the glacier and other things. They talked to us just like their friends as we were speaking Kannada! When we asked how you pass the time on glacier, only answer we got was 'finding ways to stay alive is the only way to pass the time' which explains how hostile are the conditions on the glacier.\r\n\r\nThey arranged lunch even at 5PM, even though we humbly refused as it was only for us.\r\n\r\nAs we were about to leave, they forced us to take few big packs of dry fruits worth few thousand rupees. We were really amazed by the hospitality we got in Siachen!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith commanding officers of 19th Madras\r\n\r\nIndian Army is simply superb. Isn't it?\r\n\r\nWe left Sasoma camp around 6PM with lifetime memories.\r\n\r\nWe had to stay back at Sumur as it was already dark.We couldn't reach Leh the same day as drivers don't prefer to drive in night. (We could see few people taking that risk! Anyways roads are open throughout the day)\r\nKarma told we will be reaching Leh only by next day noon. We lost another day here and this time there was no buffer. We had to drop few places which were pre planned. Still Pangyong, Chusul and Hanle were pending in the list. Went to sleep still being undecided on which place to drop.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay 7 - Chang la. The real nightmare!\r\n\r\nWe started from Sumur early morning (8AM is early morning for me!) and reached Leh by noon (4hrs drive - 120KMs). Stopped at Khardung la for pics. By the time we reached Leh we had decided to drop Hanle observatory (I was not happy with this. May be because I was the one who had arranged for permission to visit this).\r\n\r\nWe started to Pangyong around 4PM and we had planned to stay in Tangtse (12,880 ft) which is around 120KMs from Leh. We were out of luck this time as the road was blocked before Chang la. A truck had rolled over blocking the narrow pass. We came to know about it when we were still in Leh. But we thought to take the risk, being unaware of the scale of the accident. Karma was dead against this decision but we somehow convinced him.\r\n\r\nJust few KMs before Chang la, we could see the vehicles were piled up for a kilometer at least on either sides. Road was blocked from 3PM and it was already 7PM. BRO recovery vehicle came and even that broke down! Now it was a chaos as road was blocked by two vehicles also it was getting colder with dark.\r\n\r\nNear Chang la\r\n\r\n3rd Maratha regiment which was also stuck due to this accident came to rescue. All the people around there gathered to give 'Dhakka!' and move the truck. But all the efforts were in vain. Truck din't even move a single inch. We were stuck there for few hours until another recovery vehicle came from Leh at 9PM. It was pitch dark and some how the road got cleared in the mobile lights and small vehicles could pass on. It was 10PM by the time we crossed Chang la and reached Tangtse at 12 in the midnight. All the hotels were closed. There wasn't a single light in the town and it was chilling cold outside. Again Karma found a hotel, made a deal with hotelier and we stayed there at night.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay 8 - Pangyong.\r\n\r\nNext day we visited Pangyong (Many blogs are available on this) and on the way we could see Marmots.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarmots \r\n\r\nI felt Pangyong wasn't that worth visiting. It was already late and we dropped Indo-China was memorial in Chusul as well. Chusul is the only Border Personnel Meeting point (BPM) with china in the whole Ladakh region. Airstrip in Chusul is strategically very important to the security of Ladakh. Just read about it. It's really interesting.\r\n\r\nReached Leh by evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay 9 - Kargil war memorial.\r\n\r\nKarma refused to come to Srinagar as there was curfew and his vehicle was not Kargil/Srinagar registered. He found a Kargil passing taxi for us, and we started to Srinagar in morning which is whopping 434KMs from Leh along the NH1, the highway with significant importance!\r\n\r\nIn Srinagar the traffic is opened only between 12-4AM (Yes only in midnight!). So the plan was, reach Sonamarg by night. Halt there and start to Srinagar in midnight. On the way visit Kargil war memorial. Sonamarg is the place where Amarnath yatra starts.\r\n\r\nEverything went as per the plan and we reached Sonamarg by 8PM.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay 10 - Curfew hit Srinagar.\r\n\r\nTraffic was opened from Sonamarg at 12:30AM. All the vehicles were racing one another. We couldn't sleep even for few mins. Atmosphere was very tensed once we reached Srinagar. Police/Army at very corner of the city. We were sitting without a blip of eye. 'Go back India go back', 'Pray for Burhan Wani' placards were seen everywhere in the city. We reached Srinagar airport around 3AM and our flight to Delhi was at 6:30PM. Checked in to a hotel and slept the whole day as we couldn't step outside due to the curfew.\r\n\r\nSrinagar, a city which runs on tourism was completely empty and the condition was really bad.\r\n\r\nWe reached Delhi around 10PM.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay 11 - Selfie with Modi\r\n\r\nIt was August 15th and we had our passes ready to visit Red Fort. We started around 6AM, all the roads were blocked and there was complete confusion among the auto and cab drivers, on which route to take to Red Fort, and Delhi police din't manage it very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reached around 7:30AM stayed there for few hours till Modi's speech started.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe flied back to Bangalore and it welcomed us with a traffic jam! We were back to reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S - There are many other things which I haven't covered in this blog as it has already overrun the size.\r\n\r\nThings not covered here are -\r\nThe old Silk route through Ladakh.\r\nWildlife in Nubra valley\r\nLadakh region in Hindu mythology\r\nFight for free Tibet in Leh\r\nAlternate routes\r\nTips on how to visit Ladakh in 3-4 days\r\nAwesome BRO sign boards\r\nEffect of curfew in Srinagar, as I saw.\r\nFew more facts about Indian Army in Siachen.\r\nLadakh in different seasons\r\nBudget travel in Ladakh\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to thank Karma Sundup ( S/O Phunsuk Wangdu!) without him this trip would have been incomplete. I highly recommend this person if anyone visiting Ladakh. We got a friend whom we cannot forget! He can be contacted on +91-9419215193 and also on facebook.\r\n\r\nShare your feedback @ShridharKalagi\r\n\r\n",
